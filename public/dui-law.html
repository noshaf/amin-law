                        <p> A DUI is a drunk driving offense that is among the most prevalent criminal offenses committed each year. </p>
                        <p> Anyone can be convicted of a DUI offense regardless of their character since many people underestimate how much alcohol they have imbibed or the effect it has had on their judgment. </p>
                        <p> In the state of California, DUI's instigate a domino effect of consequences. Alhough most DUI convictions are misdemeanors, you still risk jail time, fines in the hundreds or thousands of dollars, loss of driving privileges for months or years and substantially increased insurance premiums.</p>
                        <p> In fact on average one may pay up to $5,000 in legal fees, a downpayment ranging from $200 - $500 in license reinstatement, and not to mention substance abuse or counseling classes depending on your case. </p>
                        <p> With regards to insurance, most insurance companies will raise rates at least $1,000 - $1,500 or more annually. This high-risk requirement typically continues for three years, after which the rates drop back down. Expect to pay between $3,000 - $4,500 over three years.</p>
                        <p> Finally, sitting in jail, doing community service, court appearances and remedial services may take you away from your job for anywhere from one week to 12 months.</p>

                        <p>Before you can be stopped by a police officer, the officer needs probable cause to believe you violated a traffic offense or some other crime. If you were observed driving erratically or rolled through a stop sign, the officer has legal or probable cause to stop you. If the officer notices certain signs of intoxication such as slurred speech, watery eyes, fumbling for your license, or unsteadiness on your feet, the officer can request that you take a chemical test of your blood alcohol content, usually a breath test.</p>
                    <p>Officers usually adminster a breathalizer test that would indicate one's BAC or blood alcohol content. If your BAC is elevated, such as 0.15% or higher, increased criminal penalties may apply. If your BAC is at least 0.08%, you are presumed to be under the influence of alcohol. For drivers under 21, your BAC must be negligible. Commercial drivers have a BAC limit of only .04%.</p>

                        <p>Once charged with a DUI, you also face an administrative process before the DMV called an APS hearing, or Administrative Per Se hearing, that can lead to your driver’s license suspension or other limitations on your driving.</p> 
                        <p>You must request a hearing WITHIN (10) DAYS of your charge! Or risk losing your right to contest your suspension including the validity of your traffic stop and arrest. This is true whether you were informed of your rights, and the accuracy of any blood alcohol test administered to you.</p>
                        <p>It is essential for an individual who has been charged with a DUI to hire an experienced California DUI attorney like us. We will investigate all the facts of your case to determine if the officer had probable cause to stop you, if there were reasonable grounds to charge you with a DUI, and if any coordination or field sobriety tests were properly conducted.</p> 
                        <p>Also, we will challenge the procedures used to test your BAC and if the police followed proper protocol and evidentiary rules. We can also represent you at an administrative hearing before the DMV regarding the suspension of your driving privileges.</p>
                        <p>There is no guarantee your DUI charges will be dismissed or that you will be found not guilty of any DUI offense, but we will ensure that your full rights have been protected, that any applicable defenses have been used, and that any plea agreement or chances at an acquittal will be zealously explored.</p>

                                <span class="dropcap-letter">Administrative Per Se Hearing</span>
                            </span><br> <br> <br> <br><p>Once charged with a DUI, you also face an administrative process before the DMV called an APS hearing, or Administrative Per Se hearing, that can lead to your driver’s license suspension or other limitations on your driving.</p> 
                            <p>You must request a hearing WITHIN (10) DAYS of your charge! Or risk losing your right to contest your suspension including the validity of your traffic stop and arrest. This is true whether you were informed of your rights, and the accuracy of any blood alcohol test administered to you.</p>
                        <p>It is essential for an individual who has been charged with a DUI to hire an experienced California DUI attorney like us. We will investigate all the facts of your case to determine if the officer had probable cause to stop you, if there were reasonable grounds to charge you with a DUI, and if any coordination or field sobriety tests were properly conducted.</p> 
                        <p>Also, we will challenge the procedures used to test your BAC and if the police followed proper protocol and evidentiary rules. We can also represent you at an administrative hearing before the DMV regarding the suspension of your driving privileges.</p>
                        <p>There is no guarantee your DUI charges will be dismissed or that you will be found not guilty of any DUI offense, but we will ensure that your full rights have been protected, that any applicable defenses have been used, and that any plea agreement or chances at an acquittal will be zealously explored.</p>
